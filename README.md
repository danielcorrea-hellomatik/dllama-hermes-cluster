## Optimisation journey -- what we changed and why

This section summarises the chronological set of optimisations applied, what worked, what was reverted, and the measured impact of each.

### Stage 1 -- Operating system baseline (5.70 -> 6.85 tok/s, +20%)

The default Raspberry Pi OS configuration is not tuned for sustained-CPU workloads. We changed:

- `cpufreq` governor from `ondemand` to `performance` on all four cores of every node. The governor is set at boot through a dedicated systemd unit ([systemd/cpu-performance.service](systemd/cpu-performance.service)).
- TCP congestion control switched to `bbr` (kernel default `cubic` is conservative for short-lived bursts).
- Swap moved to a 16 GB file on the NVMe drive on the root node and 4 GB on workers; default Pi OS uses `zram` which competes with the inference workload for CPU.
- `jemalloc 2` preloaded into both `dllama-api` and `dllama-worker` via systemd `LD_PRELOAD` (allocator with better arena locality than glibc malloc).
- `mlock` enabled on the inference processes (`LimitMEMLOCK=infinity`) so the loaded model cannot be paged out under memory pressure.

### Stage 2 -- Patching the framework (6.85 -> 7.18 tok/s, +5%)

While running the cluster we found several bugs in `distributed-llama` v0.16.5 that either crashed the daemon or wasted CPU. Eight source-level fixes were applied (see the table below). The two most important are:

- **uint8 overflow on `nBatches`** -- setting `nbatches=256` silently became `0` because of a `NnByte` field; this triggered an embedding-layer assertion. Promoting to `NnUint` enables larger batch sizes.
- **`finish_reason` empty string** -- the dllama HTTP response emitted `"finish_reason": ""`, which strict OpenAI clients (Hermes Agent) interpret as an in-progress stream and retry indefinitely. Forcing `"stop"` or `"length"` fixes the integration.

### Stage 3 -- Removing parasitic load (transient regression, restored to 7.01)

The benchmark exposed a `llama.cpp/build/bin/rpc-server` orphan process running on each worker since a previous (manual) test, consuming 1.9 GB of RAM each (5.7 GB cluster-wide). After killing it and forcing a full `swapoff -a && swapon -a` cycle, the cluster ran with 0 B swap consumption and 9.4 GB free per worker.

We also masked five unrelated systemd timers (`apt-daily`, `apt-daily-upgrade`, `man-db`, `e2scrub_all`, `rpi-zram-writeback`) that would otherwise inject I/O spikes mid-inference.

### Stage 4 -- The model change (7.01 -> 11.40 tok/s, +63%)

By far the largest single improvement came from switching the served model from **Llama 3.1 8B (dense, Q40)** to **Qwen3-30B-A3B (Mixture of Experts, Q40)**. While the total parameter count grew from 8 B to 30 B, the MoE architecture only activates 8 of 128 experts per token, so the effective per-token weight footprint dropped from ~5 GB to ~3 GB. Memory bandwidth is the binding constraint on Pi 5 (17 GB/s LPDDR4X), so reducing the per-token weight load directly increased throughput.

This is, conceptually, "streaming the weights" -- but implemented at the model architecture level rather than via software-level NVMe paging (which would be 24x slower than RAM and produce the opposite effect).

### Stage 5 -- Right-sizing the KV cache (11.40 -> 12.71 tok/s, +11%)

We initially configured `--max-seq-len 65536` to satisfy the Hermes Agent context-length check. This allocated more KV cache than fit in RAM and pushed the root node into swap. Reducing to `--max-seq-len 32768` (Qwen3-30B-A3B's native context) keeps everything in RAM, and we override Hermes's check by setting `context_length: 65536` in `~/.hermes/config.yaml`.

### Stage 6 -- Network syscall tuning (12.71 -> 13.34 tok/s, +5%)

Three socket options added to `setSocketBuffers()` in `nn-network.cpp` (patch 9):

- `SO_BUSY_POLL = 50` (microseconds) -- the kernel busy-spins for up to 50 us inside `recv()` before yielding the thread. For our 0.226 ms LAN round-trip, this saves the scheduler wakeup cost on the receive path. Measured as the largest contributor of the three.
- `SO_PRIORITY = 6` -- raises the traffic-control class of dllama packets to "interactive", reducing queue delay on the NIC under any background traffic.
- `SO_INCOMING_CPU = -1` -- hint to the kernel to deliver incoming packets to the CPU that last touched the socket, improving L1/L2 cache locality of the recv path.

### Stage 7 -- ARM-specific compiler flags (13.34 -> 13.82 tok/s, +4%)

We discovered that `objdump -d dllama | grep -cE 'udot|sdot'` returned **zero** -- the binary was not using NEON dot-product instructions despite the Cortex-A76 supporting them. The default `-march=native` enables the baseline ARMv8-A profile but not the optional `+dotprod` extension. After adding to the Makefile:

```
-mcpu=cortex-a76 -mtune=cortex-a76
-march=armv8.2-a+fp16+dotprod+rcpc
-fipa-pta -fipa-icf
-falign-functions=64 -falign-loops=64
```

The recompiled binary contained **322 `udot/sdot` instructions**. Each contributes 2-4 ops/cycle on Cortex-A76, accelerating the Q40 GEMM kernels at the heart of inference.

### Stage 8 -- NIC interrupt coalescing (no measurable gain)

`ethtool -C eth0 rx-usecs 10 tx-usecs 10` (down from the default 49) reduces the interrupt coalescing window. On our 0.226 ms LAN this was within the measurement noise (CV 0.7%), but we keep it because the theoretical benefit is real and the cost is zero.

### What we tried and reverted

All rejected configurations are documented in detail in [`docs/FAILED-ATTEMPTS.md`](docs/FAILED-ATTEMPTS.md).

### Research process

The optimisations above are not guesses. The project ran **11 separate research subagents** during exploration, each focused on a different angle: framework internals, kernel tuning, ARM compiler optimisations, alternative frameworks (EXO, prima.cpp, MNN-LLM, Cake, mistral.rs), Chinese / Asian edge LLM research, dllama community findings, memory leak audits, network-layer techniques (io_uring, eBPF, AF_XDP, QUIC), and the recent HALO paper (arXiv:2601.11676). The consolidated findings are recorded in [`docs/SUBAGENT-RESEARCH.md`](docs/SUBAGENT-RESEARCH.md).

The key insight from this research: **our 13.82 tok/s sits 6% above the publicly documented ceiling** for the same hardware class (13.04 tok/s reported by the upstream dllama author for Qwen3-30B-A3B on 4 x Pi 5 8 GB). The residual headroom of perhaps another 10-20% would require either re-architecting the synchroniser into an asynchronous pipeline (HALO-style overlap, estimated 1,500 LOC of C++ work) or migrating to a fundamentally different memory-bandwidth substrate (Apple Silicon UMA, NVIDIA GPU).

## Compile-time flags applied (Makefile)

```
CXXFLAGS += -O3 -flto -ffast-math -funroll-loops \
            -mcpu=cortex-a76 -mtune=cortex-a76 \
            -march=armv8.2-a+fp16+dotprod+rcpc \
            -fipa-pta -fipa-icf \
            -falign-functions=64 -falign-loops=64
```

These flags enable:

- Cortex-A76 specific scheduling (`-mcpu=cortex-a76`)
- NEON `udot/sdot` (int8 dot product) instructions for Q40 GEMM kernels (`+dotprod`)
- FP16 arithmetic (`+fp16`)
- Inter-procedural pointer analysis and identical code folding (`-fipa-pta -fipa-icf`)
- 64-byte alignment for cache-line locality (`-falign-functions=64 -falign-loops=64`)

Verification: the compiled `dllama` binary contains **322 dotprod instructions** after these flags (vs **0** with the upstream default). Each contributes roughly 2-4 ops per cycle vs scalar Q40.

- **Llama 3.3 70B** -- 38 GB does not fit in 4 x 16 GB. Swap-thrashed at 0.15 tok/s.
- **EXO framework** -- depends on Apple's MLX, which does not compile on ARM Linux. Apple Silicon is not just ARM.
- **prima.cpp** (HALO author's earlier work) -- ZMQ socket setup phase hung indefinitely on our cluster.
- **llama.cpp + RPC** -- Jeff Geerling measured 0.28 tok/s on a 4x Pi cluster (25x slower than single node).
- **HALO** -- 3.4x speedup but only in lossy networks (5% packet loss); only 1.12x in clean LAN; source not public; 3.5k LOC C++ port.
- **MSG_ZEROCOPY in writeMany** -- without proper completion-queue handling, kernel falls back to copy. Regressed throughput.
- **TCP_QUICKACK persistent (re-arm on every recv)** -- the extra `setsockopt` per recv exceeded the delayed-ACK savings.
- **Profile-Guided Optimisation (PGO)** -- instrumentation overhead desynchronised the all-reduce timing; `NnTransferSocketException` on first inference.
- **Pi 5 Vulkan / V3D GPU** -- no compute shaders for LLM workloads; render only.
- **Hailo-8 M.2 NPU** -- vision-class accelerator, not autoregressive transformer-class.
- **nthreads > 4** -- dllama enforces `max 4 threads` for this model topology.
- **CPU overclock 2.7 GHz** -- excluded by operational policy.
- **Rust frameworks** (`mistral.rs`, `candle`, `cake`) -- no mature multi-node ARM Linux tensor parallelism.

## Why this is at the public state-of-the-art

We surveyed the public record of distributed LLM inference on Pi clusters:

- The community baseline for the same hardware class is **13.04 tok/s** (Qwen3-30B-A3B on 4x Pi 5 8GB, reported by the upstream `distributed-llama` author in [discussion #255](https://github.com/b4rtaz/distributed-llama/discussions/255)).
- Jeff Geerling's well-known Pi cluster experiments saturate at single-node ~6 tok/s, and multi-node RPC regresses to 0.28 tok/s.
- The HALO paper (arXiv:2601.11676) only matches our regime under 5% packet loss; in clean LAN it sits within our error bars.

Our **13.82 tok/s** sits **6.0% above the public state-of-the-art** for this exact hardware. We believe the residual headroom (~3-5%) requires either re-architecting the synchroniser into async pipelines (~1500 LOC, separate project) or migrating to a model with even smaller active-parameter footprint -- both outside the scope of this work.

## Reproducibility checklist

Before declaring success on your own cluster, verify in this order:

1. `objdump -d ~/distributed-llama/dllama | grep -cE 'udot|sdot'` returns more than 200 (Cortex-A76 NEON dotprod kernels were compiled).
2. `sudo systemctl is-active dllama-api dllama-worker` returns `active` on every node.
3. `free -h` shows 0 B swap consumption after warm-up on every node.
4. `vcgencmd measure_temp` returns below 75 deg C under sustained load on every node.
5. `cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu0/cpufreq/scaling_governor` returns `performance` on every node.
6. `cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/tcp_congestion_control` returns `bbr` on every node.
7. `ethtool -c eth0 | grep rx-usecs` returns `10` on every node.
8. `python3 scripts/benchmark.py` returns 13-14 tok/s mean over 20 runs with standard deviation below 0.15.

If any of these fails, see [`INSTALL.md`](INSTALL.md) for the corresponding fix.
